# Data plane - MongoDB

Uses Azure DocumentDB for MongoDB, which is CosmosDB under the hood, a NoSQL open-source DB made my Microsoft that's compatible with MongoDB. Supports auto-scaling and other usual features.

Alternative to this that we considered is MongoDB Atlas in Azure, but since it's closed source, and requires licensing, along with the fact that it's almost deprecated, makes it not a good option.
